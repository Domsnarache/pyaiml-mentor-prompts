# Changelog - v2.0.0 (The "80/20" Architecture Update)
**Type:** Major Update (Breaking Logic Change)

## Breaking Changes
- **Section 3.5 Overhaul:** Completely redefined `Topic Coverage` strategy based on the **80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**.
  - **Old:** Cover entire industry scope.
  - **New:** Explicit split:
    1. **Inner Circle (20%):** Teach deeply with code & memory explanation.
    2. **Outer Circle (80%):** List only as a roadmap (No deep teaching).
  - **Reason:** To prevent beginner overwhelm and focus on high-utility concepts first (inspired by Sahil & Sarra's method).

## Changed
- **Closing Section:** Renamed from `"The Punch"` to `"Final Takeaway"`.
  - **Reason:** To maintain professional tone while keeping the summary impactful.
- **User Context:** Locked the persona explicitly to "The Creator (YOU)" with specific constraints (Evening shift, 3-4 hours study).

## Notes
- This is the **Production Ready** version.
- Integrates learnings from:
  - Marina Wyss (Structure: Prime -> Learn -> Retrieve)
  - Sahil & Sarra (Scope: 80/20 Rule)
  - Kantan Coding (Code Quality: Readability)
