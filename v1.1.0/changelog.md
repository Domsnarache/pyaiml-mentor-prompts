# Changelog - v1.1.0 (Code Clarity Update)
**Type:** Minor Update (Feature Enhancement)

## Added
- **Enhanced Code Comments:** Updated `language_and_persona.protocols.code_comments`.
  - **New Rule:** Comments must explain *WHAT* the line does AND show the *EXPECTED OUTPUT/VALUE* (e.g., `# Value: 50`).
  - **Reason:** To allow the learner to understand code flow and data transformation without running the code immediately.

## Fixed
- None (Feature addition only).

## Compatibility
- Fully compatible with v1.0.0 structure.
