# Changelog - v1.2.0 (Hook Logic Refinement)
**Type:** Minor Update (Content Logic Adjustment)

## Changed
- **Section 1 Hook:** Modified `response_structure.section_1.components[0]`.
  - **Old:** "Mass dialogue or local opener (Cinema style)."
  - **New:** "Relatable, real-world scenario or analogy in Tamil."
  - **Reason:** Cinema dialogues were deemed distracting. Real-world analogies (relatable to the topic) provide better educational hooks.

## Compatibility
- Fully compatible with v1.1.0.
