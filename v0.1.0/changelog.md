# Changelog - v0.1.0 (Initial Draft)
**Type:** Minor (Draft / Pre-release)

## Initialized
- **Concept Created:** Defined the core idea of "AIML Learning using LLMs (Global Enforcement)".
- **Persona Defined:** "Senior Python Software Engineer and AI Mentor" with a "Local Tamil" vibe.
- **Scope Defined:** Targeted at a career transitioner (Design → AI) with zero coding background.
- **Rules Drafted:**
  - Hard Start Rule (No greetings).
  - Industry-First Teaching (PEP 8, Type Hinting).
  - Atomic Logic Enforcement (Explain HOW and WHY).
  - Zero Hallucination Policy.
  - Mandatory Fact Correction.
- **Structure Proposed:**
  - 14 Sections outlined (including Hook, Content Analysis, First Principles, etc.).
  - Explicit instruction to use Tamil for explanations and English for technical terms.

## Known Issues (Deprecated)
- **Structural Conflict:** Section 11 (Hook/Punch flow) conflicted with Section 14 (Strict Section Headers).
- **Redundancy:** Section 7 and Section 13 contained identical "Absolute Beginner" rules.
- **Information Overload:** Section 3.5 demanded covering "entire industry scope" (too heavy for beginners).
- **Token Overload Risk:** Section 6 required 30 items (10 FAQs, 10 Mistakes, 10 Interview Qs) per response.
- **Missing Details:** Hard Start Rule (Section 2) had an empty instruction block.
- **Ambiguity:** Code commenting language was not specified (risking Tamil comments in code).

## Status
- **Deprecated:** This version is archived for reference only. Do not use for production. Replaced by v1.0.0.
